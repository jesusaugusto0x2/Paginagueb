          So, im 21 yo actually, haven't been the smartest kid in town and also
          I think I'll never be, but that's not the point of this. </br></br>

          I'm living in Venezuela, northern country from South America, unlike most
          of young people here, I'm really proud of being venezuelan, and I wouldn't
          like to leave my country, but seems like I'd have to, because goverment and
          other organizations have literally fucked up everything in here... </br></br>

          Well, not sure if I will be able to get out of this, let's hope I can. </br></br>

          In other things... I'm studying computing sciences, not sure if I will be
          good at this, for sure I'm trying but you know... Situations.. Anyway, I'm
          "developing" this website as a practice for my studies and also because
          I kinda like this, maybe I can do this for a living, let's see... </br></br>
