          Hello there! There's some info about myself...

          So, I'm 21 yo actually, haven't been the smartest kid in town and also
          I think I'll never be, but that's not the point of this. </br></br>

          I'm living in Venezuela. <black class = "tachado"> VIVA CHAVEZ </black> And
          unlike most of young people here, I'm really proud of my country, there's nothing to feel
          ashamed of... Sad thing is goverment and other organizations have literally
          fucked up everything in here, and population isn't that helpful, so it seems
          like my only way out is emigration. </br></br>

          Well, not sure if I will be able to get out of this, let's hope I can. </br></br>

          In other things, I'm studying computing sciences, not sure if I will be
          good at this, for sure I'm trying but you know... Sometimes I just feel like
          I'm not good enough. Anyway, I'm "developing" this website as a practice for my studies and also
          because I kinda like this, maybe I can do this for a living, let's see... </br></br>
