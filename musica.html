            Well, can't actually believe this worked, I mean, asked
            a friend for guidance about on how to make another webpage
            inside the main one, and he just told me to add another
            .html file and link it <black class = "tachado"> love u Edwin <3 </black>
            </br></br>

            Talking about music, I enjoy any type of music, for real...
            <black class = "tachado"> even vallenatos </black> So there's
            not much to talk about, ima just share some songs I like :P
