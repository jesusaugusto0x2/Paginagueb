          Hey there, guess you already saw my name. </br></br>

          Its kinda fun because I can't stop playing <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZgB7D5Xtbs" target="_blank"> this song </a>
          inside my head while doing this "website", but I'm sure
          the one that would really describe me the best is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8sSBX-esr8" target="_blank"> this</a>. </br></br>

          Anyway, I'm 21 years old aaand I live in Venezuela. I actually
          love my country <black class = "tachado">for real</black> but there's has been lots of issues
          with goverment, population, and as everyone knows, living here
          it's like being in the hell itself. </br></br>

          I don't consider myself smart, not even a bit. I'm insecure and
          always feel anxious about EVERYTHING. Also I'm ugly af, most of the
          stupid/weird things are the ones I like. I suck at everything I do, so
          it's pretty common in me messing things up. Maybe playing videogames is an
          exception (???) <black class = "tachado">not even that because I fucking suck
          playing DotA and CS:GO and all the games I play.</black> </br></br>

          Wanna know a secret? The images in the main page represents all the stuff
          I hate or scares me a lot.

          But oh well, I'm kinda interested in everything about web
          development, maybe I wouldn't screw it at all.. </br></br>
